# Numeric Algebra 23 Fall

23秋数值代数例题代码

## usage
open homework*.sln in Visual Studio;

Since the function.h and function.cpp are used in every homework solution, only the one in hw8 is modified. As for the rest, if you want to see annotations or edit code in VScode, please reopen them in GB2312 model;and please don't choose "save with encoding" because that doesn't always work.

In "dev" branch, CMakeLists.txt has been added, you could use cmake to configure.
